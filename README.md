# Calculator

This was the second challenge given to us at _nology.

We were to build a calculator capable of doing simple 2 number equations using vanilla JavaScript.

This is my first proper "build". It was an awesome learning journey to get this working!

The main learnings I have had during this project are --
+ The process of building a working project from 0
+ Handling string to number transitions
+ Testing for errors & handling them, giving specific user feedback
+ General JavaScript competency

Items to be refined in my calculator --
+ Use of Git branches
+ Cleaner code (some repetition & over handling present)
+ More functionality (eg. the ability to complete calculations on a number from a previous equation)
+ In the future, build in BODMAS functionality as a challenge
